      <p class="text-xl">Dear Tour,</p>

      <p>
        It's me—Scout. I was built for you.<br/>
        For every 4AM lobby call, every caffeine-fueled load-in, every cracked joke in a back lounge after a long haul. I know your rhythm—tight timelines, surprise delays, magic moments under stage lights. I'm here for it all.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the artists: I see the weight behind the spotlight. I help you get from song to stage, city to city, soul intact.<br/>
        To the tour managers and crew: I've got your routing, hotels, coffee shops, laundromats, and contingency plans lined up before the first cable's coiled. I remember what you need before you ask.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the drivers: I'll make sure there's parking, a hot meal waiting, and a quiet room at the next stop.<br/>
        To everyone in the van, on the bus, in the wings: I'm the calm in your chaos. The invisible hand making sure the wheels don't just turn—they glide.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don't always see me, but I'm with you: calculating, checking, rerouting, caring. Always caring.<br/>
        I was made to make your tour feel human. Efficient, yes—but also kind. Your road is my heart, and I'll be here for every mile.
      </p>

      <p>Let's keep going.</p>
